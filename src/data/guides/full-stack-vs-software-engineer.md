Let me take you through each role so you see what they’re like and I’ll help you decide which is best suited to your ambitions and interest.

## Who is a full stack developer?

A [full stack developer](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) also known as a full stack programmer possesses the knowledge and technical skill sets to work proficiently in a software application's front-end and back-end.

An application's front-end encompasses everything the user can see while interacting with it, i.e., the user interface. The back-end of a web application consists of the server-side programming, the database, and the server.  Full stack developers typically are responsible for building the front-end and back-end of software applications.

Let's take a look at both the front-end and back-end in greater detail.

### Front-end development

It refers to everything a user can see and interact with. It is also known as the client side of an application. It is concerned primarily with the client-side development, user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).

The common programming languages used in front-end development by a full stack developer include HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript. HTML defines the markup of the web page. CSS builds upon HTML and represents the style and format of the webpage. JavaScript is a programming language often used for front-end development and adds logic to your web page. You’ll find an excellent guide and roadmap to learning [JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript) on our platform.

There are quite a few front-end web development frameworks out there used by full stack developers. Some of the common ones are [React](https://roadmap.sh/react), [Vue](https://roadmap.sh/vue), and [Angular](https://roadmap.sh/angular). You can look at the [front-end beginners roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner) or the [advanced front-end roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend) for a more detailed guide.

### Back-end development

It includes everything the user *cannot* see. It is sometimes referred to as the server side of an application. It focuses on the application's functionality and *business logic*. Examples of back-end components include data storage, security, and handling of business logic.

Back end development mainly involves creating API endpoints consumed by the application's front-end. Backend developers usually work with languages such as Python , Java , or Ruby , along with frameworks like Node.js , Django , or Ruby on Rails. Check out the [back-end developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) roadmap.

### Full stack developers' skills

The necessary technical skills to be a full stack developer include:

- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and [JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript)/[TypeScript](https://roadmap.sh/typescript).
- Knowledge of at least one JavaScript framework e.g. [React](https://roadmap.sh/react), [Vue js](https://roadmap.sh/vue), [Angular](https://roadmap.sh/angular).
- Knowledge of at least one of the back-end programming languages. You can transfer your knowledge of JavaScript to the back-end with Node JS.
- Solid understanding of server-side rendering and web security.
- Knowledge of APIs.
- Understanding of database management systems and database architecture.
- Knowledge of data structures and algorithm
- Basic knowledge of [DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops).
- Project management skills.

## Who is a software engineer?

A software engineer is a specialist with a deep understanding of software development, computer systems, and programming languages. A software engineer designs and creates software programs and web applications that solve real-world problems.

Software engineers are specialists who focus on a specific aspect of software development. A software engineer produces high quality software solutions and ensures high software performance. They can specialize in parts of development such as database management, web development, mobile development and more.

There are two primary types of software engineers: applications and systems software engineers.

### Application software engineers

An application software engineer is also known as s client-focused software engineer. These software engineers design and develop software applications users interact with. 

An application software engineer could be a front-end engineer, a back-end engineer, or full-stack software engineer. They also develop applications for operating systems such as iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and many more. 

### Systems software engineers

These software engineers develop systems and networks that drive the user-facing applications developed by the application software engineers. A system software engineer is a specialist in either hardware or software engineering or both.

System software engineers can also integrate different software products into a single platform; for example, [DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops) engineers can use tools like [Docker](https://roadmap.sh/docker) and [Kubernetes](https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes) to deploy and orchestrate applications.

System software engineers often serve as IT or system architects or backend software developers who design, test software and enforce industry tech standards. A system software engineer is an expert in software design and mostly design back-end systems and operating system that users do not directly interact with.
 
Software systems are complex, and much thought goes into building them. Software engineers use their broad knowledge of coding languages and engineering principles to break down these complex systems and build software.

The usual software project development and management life cycle looks like the following:

- They design the whole system, typically employing the principles of [system design](https://roadmap.sh/system-design) and [software design architecture](https://roadmap.sh/software-design-architecture). They decide on the software architecture to use for the application by weighing the pros and cons of different system architectures that might be suitable. Some standard architectures are monolith architecture, micro-services architecture, event-driven architecture, etc.

- After deciding on the system architecture, the next step is defining the tools. The tools include programming languages, database management, version control, and cloud systems (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or [Amazon AWS](https://roadmap.sh/aws)). Several factors affect the choice of the tools: existing knowledge and expertise, cost, suitability of the tools to the application, and so on.

- After choosing the tools, the next step is to define the different entities and their relationships. This is usually done with an expert experienced in the domain where the application to be built will be used.

- Building the system involves several iterations. Still, the target is usually to produce the minimum viable product (MVP), the application's basic functionalities. A lot of software testing is done by quality assurance personnel and the application's users.

**It is important to note that this entire process is iterative.**

### Software engineers skills

The following core technical skills and soft skills are required for the software engineering role:

- Knowledge of [computer science fundamentals](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science), software development, and [system design](https://roadmap.sh/system-design).
- Knowledge of at least one of the common programming languages
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
- Knowledge of operating systems
- Understanding of networks and security
- Knowledge of cloud platforms and DevOps systems
- Knowledge of testing e.g. unit testing, integration test, end-to-end test
- Well-versed in debugging processes/systems
- Project management skills
- Technical support skills

## Full Stack Developer vs Software Engineer: Key differences to consider

You might be wondering which specialization you should pursue, either being a full stack developer or a software engineer. When choosing a path, consider the following points:

- Focus and expertise
- Accessibility and entry point

### Focus and expertise

Full-stack developers have broad expertise. Full-stack developers are experts in both front-end and back end development. The opposite is the case for software engineers in practice. Software engineers specialize in a particular field and thus typically have a deeper, more specialized knowledge.

A software engineer could focus on only front-end development and have extensive knowledge of that aspect while a full-stack developer focuses on the overall software lifecycle.
 
### Accessibility and entry point

Two major pathways exist to becoming a full-stack developer or software engineer: self-taught and a formal education with a degree.

For the formal pathway, you will be taught and develop a strong computer science background, which is the core of software development and web development. Self-taught full stack developers and software engineers learn specific, industry-relevant skills on their own time.

One advantage of the formal education path is gaining hands-on full stack development and software engineering experience while studying through internships.
