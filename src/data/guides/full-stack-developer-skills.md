![The best full stack developer skills to learn.](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/full-stack-developer-skills-abb38.jpg)

It should be no surprise to anyone that given the fast pace of the web development industry, every type of developer, especially full stack developers, must stay ahead of the curve by continuously updating their skills.

Full-stack web developers share a unique blend of expertise that allows them to independently build and maintain entire web applications. However, this mix of skills is a double-edged sword because it makes staying up-to-date harder for them.
In this article, we will explore the 8 essential full stack developer skills that you need to master and thrive in your career.

Remember that you have more details about the different technologies and topics to cover in our [full stack developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack).

## Understanding full-stack development

Full stack development involves both frontend and backend work. It means you're not just limited to designing the parts of a website or application that users interact with (frontend), but also managing the server, database, and application logic that power those interactions (backend).

Plus, full-stack developers need to be proficient in working with both relational and non-relational databases, setting up and maintaining infrastructure, and ensuring that their applications are scalable and secure. In other words, if they need to, full-stack developers can be the equivalent of a one-man army. Is this an ideal situation? No, it isn’t. In fact, a better way to look at a full stack developer is to think of them as a wildcard that can be placed in any team, and they’ll consistently add value to it, with minimum ramp-up time needed.

With that foundation in mind, let's dive into the specific skills you need to master.

## 1. Basic understanding of HTTP

![basic understand of HTTP](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/understanding-http-pct23.png)

Let’s start with the basics: understanding HTTP. HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of any interaction on the web. It’s what allows clients (like your web browser) and servers to communicate with each other. As a full-stack developer, having a solid grasp of HTTP is crucial for building, debugging, and maintaining web applications. It’s your bread and butter, and you’ll need to internalize it if you hope to become great at your job.

### Why HTTP Matters for Full Stack Developers?
Without HTTP, the internet as we know it wouldn’t function, it’s that simple. For a full-stack developer, understanding HTTP means you can effectively manage how your frontend communicates with your backend.

### Key Concepts to understand in HTTP

- **HTTP Methods**: These are the actions that can be performed on a resource. The most common methods are GET (to retrieve data), POST (to send data to the server), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to remove data). Each method has a specific purpose and knowing when to use each one is essential for building efficient APIs. You can read the [full list of verbs here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).
- **Status Codes**: HTTP status codes are responses from the server to the client's request. They indicate whether the request was successful, if there was an error, or if further action is needed. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 403 (Forbidden). Understanding these codes helps in debugging and improving user experience. Here’s the [full list of status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) in case you’re wondering.
- **Headers**: HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between the client and server. They carry essential information like content type, authorization information (in some cases even credentials), and cache control. Familiarity with headers allows you to manage security, content negotiation, and request-response flow more effectively. While you can create your own, here’s a list of the [standard set of HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).

## 2. HTML/CSS/JavaScript

![html, css & javascript](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/html-css-javascript-layers-7agjb.png)

For full-stack developers, a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential. These technologies are the building blocks of the visual side of the web, enabling you to create an engaging and functional user interface. While you'll need many other coding skills, mastering these three should be your first priority.

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML forms the backbone of any web page, providing structure and content. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and multimedia components.

**Key Features**:

- **Semantic Elements**: Elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` enhance accessibility and SEO. Properly using these elements makes your content more understandable for users, search engines, and accessibility devices like screen readers.
- **Foundational**: Understanding HTML is crucial for laying the foundation of any web application, making it an essential skill for full stack developers.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is responsible for the visual presentation of a web page. It controls layout, colors, fonts, and overall style, making your web pages visually appealing.

**Key Features**:

- **Rich visual elements**: Features like Flexbox, Grid Layout, animations, and transitions allow you to create complex designs with minimal code.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries, Flexbox, and Grid are vital for creating web pages that look great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

### JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. In other words, it makes the webpage come to life.

**Key Features**:

- **Modern JavaScript**: Features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, modules, and promises make your code more concise and readable.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript makes your web pages interactive, responding to user actions in real time.

## 3. Writing Modern JavaScript

![modern javascript](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/modern-javascript-js84y.jpg)

Modern JavaScript is a key element for full stack development, bringing not just new syntax but powerful tools that make development more efficient and scalable. Mastering this involves understanding how to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the JS-world, and it also involves technologies such as: npm, build-tools, and bundlers that streamline the development process.

## 5. Backend Programming Language

![backend programming languages](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/ruby-python-javascript-java-code-h3wyj.jpg)

Choosing the right backend programming language is crucial for building robust and efficient server-side applications. Here are some of the most popular languages used in backend development, each with its own unique features and benefits. You can read this detailed guide for more options and a complete description of each one: [The best backend languages to master](https://roadmap.sh/backend/languages).

**JavaScript (Node.js)**: JavaScript, primarily known for front-end development, extends to the backend through Node.js. Node.js allows for server-side scripting, enabling full stack developers to use the same language for both client-side and server-side development. When it comes to picking a single language for full stack development, JavaScript definitely takes the lead.

**Python**: Python is well known for its simplicity and readability, making it a favorite among developers. Its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Django and Flask, streamlines backend development and makes full stack web development very straightforward. Python's versatility and ease of use make it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

**Ruby**: Ruby is known for its elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. Ruby on Rails, a powerful web application framework, simplifies the process of building web applications by providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. Its convention-over-configuration approach makes development faster and easier.

There are many more options, and as a full stack developer, you’ll need to understand the type of technologies you feel more comfortable with, before choosing the language for your backend.

## 6. Consuming and Creating RESTful APIs

![restful apis](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/restful-apis-q1gvl.png)

For full stack developers, working with RESTful APIs is a fundamental skill that bridges the front-end and back-end of web applications. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software systems to communicate with each other, enabling your front-end to interact seamlessly with server-side logic and data.

### Consuming RESTful APIs

Consuming APIs involves making HTTP requests from your front-end application to retrieve or send data to the server. Here are the key concepts:

- **HTTP Methods**: Understanding the different HTTP methods is crucial. We’ve already mentioned them above when describing HTTP itself, so make sure to check out the links listed there for more details.
- **Endpoints and Routes**: An API endpoint is a specific path where your API can be accessed by a client. Each endpoint corresponds to a route in your back-end server, handling specific requests. In the case of RESTful APIs, these routes refer to resources in your system.
- **Request and Response**: When consuming an API, the front-end sends a request to the server and receives a response. The request typically includes headers (metadata about the request) and a body (data sent to the server), while the response contains the status code, headers, and data.
- **Fetching Data**: In JavaScript, you can use the native fetch API or libraries like Axios to make HTTP requests.

### Creating RESTful APIs

Creating APIs involves setting up server-side routes and handling requests. Here’s how to get started:

- **Define Routes**: In your back-end framework (like Express for Node.js or Django for Python), define routes that correspond to different endpoints. Each route should handle a specific HTTP method.
- **Handle Requests and Responses**: For each route, write logic to handle incoming requests and send appropriate responses. Use status codes to indicate the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
- **Middleware**: Middleware functions in frameworks like Express can process requests before they reach the endpoint handlers. They’re useful for tasks like authentication, logging, and data validation.
- **Database Integration**: Often, your API will interact with a database. Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like Sequelize for SQL databases or Mongoose for MongoDB to manage database operations.
- **REST Principles**: Ensure your API follows REST principles, such as statelessness (each request is independent), resource-based URLs (use nouns for endpoints), and appropriate use of HTTP methods. You can [read here](https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) the full details about REST from the paper that defined the concept.

## 7. Databases

![relational databases](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/relational-cb-vs-non-relational-db-9r4m5.png)

Understanding both relational and non-relational databases is crucial for managing and storing data effectively in your applications. Each type of database has its own strengths and use cases, and knowing when to use each is essential for building robust and scalable applications.

### Relational Databases

Relational databases store data in structured tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data. Here are some key relational databases:

- **MySQL**: MySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational databases. It's known for its ease of use (a common choice for new developers) and performance.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its advanced features and compliance with SQL standards. It supports complex queries, transactions, and extensibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **SQLite**: SQLite is a lightweight, disk-based database that's easy to set up and use. It's often used in embedded systems and applications that require a simple, self-contained database engine. You’re not going to see big systems using SQLite for its main database, but it’s very common in small projects.

### Non-Relational Databases

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, store data in various formats such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Here are some popular non-relational databases:

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It’s highly flexible and scalable, making it ideal for applications that require quick iterations and schema flexibility.
- **Redis**: Redis is an in-memory key-value store known for its high performance and speed. It’s commonly used for caching, real-time analytics, and as a message broker.
- **Cassandra**: Cassandra is a distributed, wide-column store designed for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers without any single point of failure. It's highly scalable and suitable for applications that require high availability and performance.

In the end, like with many other technologies, there is not one single option that’s better than the others. It’s more about your particular needs and the features of each database. When having to decide on a specific database option, try to understand their capabilities and try to match them to your particular context.

## 8. Hosting and Infrastructure

![deployment insfrastructure](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/deployment-infrastructures-jrvr9.png)

For full stack developers, understanding hosting and infrastructure is essential for deploying and managing their web applications. This involves knowing where to host your applications, how to set up servers, and how to ensure your application runs smoothly and efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of key concepts and services in this area:

### Cloud Hosting Providers

Cloud hosting providers offer scalable and flexible solutions for hosting web applications. They provide various services including virtual machines, storage, databases, and more. Some of the most popular providers are:
