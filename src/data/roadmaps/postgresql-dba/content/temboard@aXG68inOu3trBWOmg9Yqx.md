# temBoard

temBoard is an open-source monitoring and management tool for PostgreSQL databases developed by Dalibo. It provides a web-based interface that helps database administrators (DBAs) manage and monitor multiple PostgreSQL instances efficiently. Key features of temBoard include:

1.	Real-Time Monitoring: Offers real-time insights into database performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and query performance. This helps DBAs quickly identify and address potential issues.
2.	Agent-Based Architecture: Uses a lightweight agent installed on each PostgreSQL instance to collect metrics and perform management tasks. This architecture ensures minimal performance impact on the monitored databases.
3.	Alerting and Notifications: Configurable alerts and notifications allow DBAs to receive timely updates on critical database events and performance issues, enabling proactive management and quicker response times.
4.	Performance Analysis: Provides detailed performance analysis tools, including query statistics and historical performance data. This allows DBAs to analyze trends, identify bottlenecks, and optimize database performance.
5.	User Management and Security: Supports user authentication and role-based access control, ensuring secure management of PostgreSQL instances. It also provides an audit log for tracking user activities.
6.	Plugin System: Extensible through plugins, allowing customization and addition of new features as needed.
