# OLAP

Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) in PostgreSQL refers to a class of systems designed for query-intensive tasks, typically used for data analysis and business intelligence. OLAP systems handle complex queries that aggregate large volumes of data, often from multiple sources, to support decision-making processes. PostgreSQL supports OLAP workloads through features such as advanced indexing, table partitioning, and the ability to create materialized views for faster query performance. Additionally, PostgreSQL's support for parallel query execution and extensions like Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) and PostGIS enhance its capability to handle large datasets and spatial data, making it a robust platform for analytical applications.
