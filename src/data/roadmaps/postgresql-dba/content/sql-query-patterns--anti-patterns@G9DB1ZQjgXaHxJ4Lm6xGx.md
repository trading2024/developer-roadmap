# Schema Design Patterns in PostgreSQL

Schema query patterns in PostgreSQL optimize data retrieval and manipulation by using indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up SELECT queries, optimizing joins with indexed foreign keys and appropriate join types, and leveraging table partitioning to limit data scans. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) break down complex queries for better readability and maintainability, while window functions allow advanced analytics within queries. Query caching and prepared statements reduce access times and execution overhead, respectively, and materialized views precompute and store complex query results for faster access. These patterns collectively enhance the efficiency, performance, and reliability of PostgreSQL queries.
