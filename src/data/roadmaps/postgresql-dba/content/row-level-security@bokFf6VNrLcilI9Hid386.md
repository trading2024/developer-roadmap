# Row Level Security (RLS)

Row Level Security (RLS) is a feature introduced in PostgreSQL 9.5 that allows you to control access to rows in a table based on a user or role's permissions. This level of granularity in data access provides an extra layer of security for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
