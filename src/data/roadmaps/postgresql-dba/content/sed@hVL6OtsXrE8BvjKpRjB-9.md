# Sed: The Stream Editor

Sed is a powerful command-line utility for text processing and manipulation in Unix-based systems, including Linux operating systems. It operates on a text stream – reading from a file, standard input, or a pipe from another command – and applies a series of editing instructions known as "scripts" to transform the input text into a desired output format.
