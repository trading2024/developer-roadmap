# System Catalog

The PostgreSQL system catalog is a set of tables and views that store metadata about the database objects, providing critical information for database management and querying. Key system catalog tables include `pg_database` (information about databases), `pg_tables` (details of tables), `pg_indexes` (index information), `pg_class` (general information about tables, indexes, and sequences), `pg_attribute` (column details for each table), and `pg_roles` (user and role information). These catalogs enable the database engine and users to efficiently manage schema, security, and query optimization, ensuring effective database operations and maintenance.
