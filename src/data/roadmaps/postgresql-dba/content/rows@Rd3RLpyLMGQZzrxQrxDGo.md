# Rows in PostgreSQL

A row in PostgreSQL represents a single, uniquely identifiable record with a specific set of fields in a table. Each row in a table is made up of one or more columns, where each column can store a specific type of data (e.g., integer, character, date, etc.). The structure of a table determines the schema of its rows, and each row in a table must adhere to this schema.
