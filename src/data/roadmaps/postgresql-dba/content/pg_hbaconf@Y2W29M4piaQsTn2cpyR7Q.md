# PostgreSQL Security: pg_hba.conf

When securing your PostgreSQL database, one of the most important components to configure is the `pg_hba.conf` (short for PostgreSQL Host-Based Authentication Configuration) file. This file is a part of PostgreSQL's Host-Based Authentication (HBA) system and is responsible for controlling how clients authenticate and connect to your database.
