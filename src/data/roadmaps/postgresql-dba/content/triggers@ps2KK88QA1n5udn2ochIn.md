# Advanced SQL: Triggers

Triggers are special user-defined functions that get invoked automatically when an event (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE`) occurs on a specified table or view. They allow you to perform additional actions when data is modified in the database, helping to maintain the integrity and consistency of your data.
