# GIST Indexes

The Generalized Search Tree (GiST) is a powerful and flexible index type in PostgreSQL that serves as a framework to implement different indexing strategies. GiST provides a generic infrastructure for building custom indexes, extending the core capabilities of PostgreSQL. This powerful indexing framework allows you to extend PostgreSQL's built-in capabilities, creating custom indexing strategies aligned with your specific requirements.
