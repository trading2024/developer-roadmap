# Data Types in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL offers a comprehensive set of data types to cater to diverse data needs, including numeric types like `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, and `SERIAL` for auto-incrementing fields; character types such as `VARCHAR` and `TEXT` for variable-length text; and temporal types like `DATE`, `TIME`, and `TIMESTAMP` for handling date and time data. Additionally, PostgreSQL supports `BOOLEAN` for true/false values, `ENUM` for enumerated lists, and composite types for complex structures. It also excels with `JSON` and `JSONB` for storing and querying semi-structured data, arrays for storing multiple values in a single field, and geometric types for spatial data. These data types ensure flexibility and robust data management for various applications.
