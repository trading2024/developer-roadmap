# Core Dumps

A core dump is a file that contains the memory image of a running process and its process status. It's typically generated when a program crashes or encounters an unrecoverable error, allowing developers to analyze the state of the program at the time of the crash. In the context of PostgreSQL, core dumps can help diagnose and fix issues with the database system.
