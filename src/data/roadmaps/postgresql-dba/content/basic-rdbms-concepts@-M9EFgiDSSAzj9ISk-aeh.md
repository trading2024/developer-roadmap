# RDBMS Concepts

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are a type of database management system which stores and organizes data in tables, making it easy to manipulate, query, and manage the information. They follow the relational model defined by E.F. Codd in 1970, which means that data is represented as tables with rows and columns.
