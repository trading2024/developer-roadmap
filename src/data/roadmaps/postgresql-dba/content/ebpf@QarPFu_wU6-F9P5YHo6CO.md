# eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)

eBPF is a powerful Linux kernel technology used for tracing and profiling various system components such as processes, filesystems, network connections, and more. It has gained enormous popularity among developers and administrators because of its ability to offer deep insights into the system's behavior, performance, and resource usage at runtime. In the context of profiling PostgreSQL, eBPF can provide valuable information about query execution, system calls, and resource consumption patterns.
