# Resources Usage

Configuring PostgreSQL for optimal resource usage involves adjusting settings in the `postgresql.conf` file to balance memory, CPU, and disk usage. 

Key parameters include `shared_buffers`, typically set to 25-40% of total RAM, to optimize caching; `work_mem`, which should be adjusted based on the complexity and number of concurrent queries, often starting at 1-2MB per connection; `maintenance_work_mem`, set higher (e.g., 64MB) to speed up maintenance tasks; `effective_cache_size`, usually set to about 50-75% of total RAM to inform the planner about available cache; and `max_connections`, which should be carefully set based on available resources to avoid overcommitting memory. Additionally, `autovacuum` settings should be fine-tuned to ensure regular cleanup without overloading the system. Adjusting these parameters helps PostgreSQL efficiently utilize available hardware, improving performance and stability.
