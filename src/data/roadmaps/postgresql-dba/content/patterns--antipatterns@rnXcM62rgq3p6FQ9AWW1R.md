# Practical Patterns and Antipatterns for Queues in PostgreSQL

Practical patterns for implementing queues in PostgreSQL include using a dedicated table to store queue items, leveraging the `FOR` `UPDATE` `SKIP` `LOCKED` clause to safely dequeue items without conflicts, and partitioning tables to manage large volumes of data efficiently. Employing batch processing can also enhance performance by processing multiple queue items in a single transaction. Antipatterns to avoid include using high-frequency polling, which can lead to excessive database load, and not handling concurrency properly, which can result in data races and deadlocks. Additionally, storing large payloads directly in the queue table can degrade performance; instead, store references to the payloads. By following these patterns and avoiding antipatterns, you can build efficient and reliable queuing systems in PostgreSQL.
