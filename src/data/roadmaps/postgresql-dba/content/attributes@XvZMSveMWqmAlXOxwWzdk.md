# Attributes in the Relational Model

Attributes in the relational model are the columns of a table, representing the properties or characteristics of the entity described by the table. Each attribute has a domain, defining the possible values it can take, such as integer, text, or date. Attributes play a crucial role in defining the schema of a relation (table) and are used to store and manipulate data. They are fundamental in maintaining data integrity, enforcing constraints, and enabling the relational operations that form the basis of SQL queries.
