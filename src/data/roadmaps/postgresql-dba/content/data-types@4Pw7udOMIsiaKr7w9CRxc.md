# Data Types in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL offers a rich and diverse set of data types, catering to a wide range of applications and ensuring data integrity and performance. These include standard numeric types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and serial types for auto-incrementing fields. Character types like VARCHAR and TEXT handle varying lengths of text, while DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP support a variety of temporal data requirements. PostgreSQL also supports a comprehensive set of Boolean, enumerated (ENUM), and composite types, enabling more complex data structures. Additionally, it excels with its support for JSON and JSONB data types, allowing for efficient storage and querying of semi-structured data. The inclusion of array types, geometric data types, and the PostGIS extension for geographic data further extends PostgreSQL's versatility, making it a powerful tool for a broad spectrum of data management needs.
