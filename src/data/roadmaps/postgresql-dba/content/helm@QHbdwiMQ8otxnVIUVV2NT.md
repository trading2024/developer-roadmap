# Helm - Package Manager for Kubernetes

Helm is a popular package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to easily deploy, manage, and upgrade applications on your Kubernetes cluster. In the Kubernetes world, Helm plays a similar role as "apt" or "yum" in the Linux ecosystem.

Helm streamlines the installation process by providing ready-to-use packages called "charts". A Helm chart is a collection of YAML files, templates, and manifests, that describe an application's required resources and configurations.
