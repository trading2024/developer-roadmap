# Aggregate and Window Functions

Aggregate functions in PostgreSQL perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value, such as `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`. Window functions, on the other hand, calculate values across a set of table rows related to the current row while preserving the row structure. Common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE()`, `LAG()`, and `LEAD()`. These functions are crucial for data analysis, enabling complex queries and insights by summarizing and comparing data effectively.
