# Operators in Kubernetes Deployment

Operators in Kubernetes are software extensions that use custom resources to manage applications and their components. They encapsulate operational knowledge and automate complex tasks such as deployments, backups, and scaling. Using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and custom controllers, Operators continuously monitor the state of the application and reconcile it with the desired state, ensuring the system is self-healing and resilient. Popular frameworks for building Operators include the Operator SDK, Kubebuilder, and Metacontroller, which simplify the process and enhance Kubernetes' capability to manage stateful and complex applications efficiently.
