# Filtering Data in PostgreSQL

Filtering data is an essential feature in any database management system, and PostgreSQL is no exception. When we refer to filtering data, we're talking about selecting a particular subset of data that fulfills specific criteria or conditions. In PostgreSQL, we use the **WHERE** clause to filter data in a query based on specific conditions.
