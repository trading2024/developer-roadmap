# SSL Settings in PostgreSQL

Securing the communication channels is a crucial aspect of protecting your PostgreSQL database from different types of attacks. One way to achieve this security is by using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connections. By enabling and configuring SSL, you add an extra layer of security to your PostgreSQL database, ensuring the data transferred between the client and server is encrypted and protected.
