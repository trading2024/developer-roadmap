# PostgreSQL vs. Other Databases

PostgreSQL stands out among other RDBMS options due to its open-source nature, advanced features, and robust performance. Unlike proprietary systems like Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL is free to use and highly extensible, allowing users to add custom functions, data types, and operators. It supports a wide range of indexing techniques and provides advanced features such as full-text search, JSON support, and geographic information system (GIS) capabilities through PostGIS. Additionally, PostgreSQL's strong adherence to SQL standards ensures compatibility and ease of migration. While systems like MySQL are also popular and known for their speed in read-heavy environments, PostgreSQL often surpasses them in terms of functionality and compliance with ACID properties, making it a versatile choice for complex, transactional applications.
