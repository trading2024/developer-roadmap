# Introduction to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS) that is known for its robustness, extensibility, and SQL compliance. It was initially developed at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1980s and has since become one of the most popular open-source databases in the world.
