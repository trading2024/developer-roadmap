# pgCluu

PgCluu is a powerful and easy-to-use PostgreSQL performance monitoring and tuning tool. This open-source program collects statistics and provides various metrics in order to analyze PostgreSQL databases, helping you discover performance bottlenecks and optimize your cluster's performance. Apart from PostgreSQL-specific settings, you can also tweak other options, such as the RRDtool's data file format (JPG or SVG), time range for graphs, and more.
