# Data Partitioning

Data partitioning is a technique that divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions. Each partition is a smaller table that stores a subset of the data, usually based on specific criteria such as ranges, lists, or hashes. Partitioning can improve query performance, simplifies data maintenance tasks, and optimizes resource utilization.
