# PostgreSQL Anonymizer

PostgreSQL Anonymizer is an extension designed to mask or anonymize sensitive data within PostgreSQL databases. It provides various anonymization techniques, including randomization, generalization, and pseudonymization, to protect personal and sensitive information in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR. This extension can be configured to apply these techniques to specific columns or datasets, ensuring that the anonymized data remains useful for development, testing, or analysis without exposing actual sensitive information.
