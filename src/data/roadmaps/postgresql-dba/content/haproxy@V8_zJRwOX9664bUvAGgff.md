# HAProxy

HAProxy, short for High Availability Proxy, is a popular open-source software used to provide high availability, load balancing, and proxying features for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is commonly used to improve the performance, security, and reliability of web applications, databases, and other services. When it comes to load balancing in PostgreSQL, HAProxy is a popular choice due to its flexibility and efficient performance. By distributing incoming database connections across multiple instances of your PostgreSQL cluster, HAProxy can help you achieve better performance, high availability, and fault tolerance.
