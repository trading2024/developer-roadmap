# Chef for PostgreSQL Configuration Management

Chef is a powerful and widely-used configuration management tool that provides a simple yet customizable way to manage your infrastructure, including PostgreSQL installations. Chef is an open-source automation platform written in Ruby that helps users manage their infrastructure by creating reusable and programmable code, called "cookbooks" and "recipes", to define the desired state of your systems. It uses a client-server model and employs these cookbooks to ensure that your infrastructure is always in the desired state.
