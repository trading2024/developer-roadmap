# Merge Sort

__Merge sort__ is a type of sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. This algorithm works by dividing an unsorted list into `n` partitions, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), then repeatedly merging partitions to produce new sorted lists until there is only 1 sorted list remaining. This resulting list is the fully sorted list. The process of dividing the list is done recursively until it hits the base case of a list with one item. Merge sort has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` for all cases (best, average and worst), which makes it highly efficient for large data sets.
