# Server APIs

The react-dom/server APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server. These APIs are only used on the server at the top level of your app to generate the initial HTML. A [framework](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks) may call them for you. Most of your components donâ€™t need to import or use them.
