# Batch Processing in API Design

Batch Processing refers to the method of handling bulk data requests in API design. Here, multiple API requests are packed and processed as a single group or 'batch'. Instead of making numerous individual API calls, a user can make one batch request with numerous operations. This approach can increase performance and efficiency by reducing the overhead of establishing and closing multiple connections. The concept of 'batch processing' in API design is particularly useful in data-intensive applications or systems where the need for processing high volumes of data is prevalent.
