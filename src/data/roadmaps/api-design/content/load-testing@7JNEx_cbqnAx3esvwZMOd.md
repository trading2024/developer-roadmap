# Load Testing in API Design

Load testing is a crucial aspect of API design that ensures reliability, efficiency and performance under varying loads. It primarily focuses on identifying the maximum capacity of the API in terms of the volume of requests it can handle and its subsequent behavior when this threshold is reached or overloaded. By simulating varying degrees of user load, developers can identify and rectify bottlenecks or breakdown points in the system, hence enhancing overall API resilience.
