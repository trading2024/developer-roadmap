# What and when to use HCP?

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) is best used when organizations need a managed, scalable solution for their infrastructure-as-code practices. It's particularly valuable for teams seeking to streamline operations across multi-cloud environments, enhance collaboration, and maintain consistent governance. HCP is ideal when there's a need for centralized management of Terraform workflows, secure remote operations, and integrated secrets management. It's beneficial for large enterprises or growing teams that require robust access controls, policy enforcement, and audit capabilities. HCP should be considered when the complexity of self-managing HashiCorp tools becomes a burden, or when there's a desire to reduce operational overhead. It's also useful when organizations want to leverage the synergies between different HashiCorp products like Terraform, Vault, and Consul in a unified, managed environment. The platform is most effective when scaling infrastructure management needs outgrow the capabilities of standalone Terraform implementations.
