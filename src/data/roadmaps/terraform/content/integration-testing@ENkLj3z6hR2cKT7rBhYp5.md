# Integration Testing

Terraform integration testing involves verifying that Terraform configurations work correctly with actual cloud resources and services. These tests create real infrastructure components, interact with them, and then destroy them, ensuring that resources are properly provisioned and configured in a live environment. Integration tests typically use frameworks like Terratest or custom scripts to automate the process of applying Terraform configurations, validating the resulting infrastructure, and cleaning up afterwards. They check for correct resource creation, proper configuration of interdependent resources, and overall system behavior. While more time-consuming and potentially costly than unit tests, integration tests provide high confidence in the reliability of Terraform code in real-world scenarios. They're crucial for catching issues that may only appear when interacting with actual cloud services, such as API limitations or unexpected service behaviors.
