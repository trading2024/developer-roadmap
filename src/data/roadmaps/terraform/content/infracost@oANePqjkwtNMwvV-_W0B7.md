# Infracost

Infracost is an open-source tool that provides real-time cost estimates for Terraform projects. It analyzes Terraform configuration files and generates detailed cost breakdowns for cloud resources across various providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Infracost integrates into CI/CD pipelines to show cost implications of infrastructure changes during the development process. It supports diff outputs, showing how proposed changes will affect costs. This tool is particularly valuable for teams looking to optimize cloud spending and maintain cost awareness throughout the infrastructure development lifecycle. Infracost can be used standalone or integrated with other tools, helping teams make informed decisions about resource provisioning and configuration changes.
