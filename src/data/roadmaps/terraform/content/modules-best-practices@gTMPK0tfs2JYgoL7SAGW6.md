# Modules Best Practices

Terraform module best practices focus on creating reusable, maintainable, and scalable infrastructure components.
 
- Modules should have a single, clear purpose and be designed with flexibility in mind, using input variables for customization.
- Outputs should be carefully chosen to provide necessary information without over-exposing internal details.
- Version your modules and use semantic versioning to manage changes.
- Keep modules small and focused, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
- Document your modules thoroughly, including usage examples and input/output descriptions.
- Use consistent naming conventions and structure across modules.
- Test modules in isolation and as part of larger systems.
- Avoid hard-coding values that might change across environments.
- Consider using nested modules for complex structures, but be mindful of over-nesting.
- Regularly review and refactor modules to incorporate improvements and maintain best practices.
