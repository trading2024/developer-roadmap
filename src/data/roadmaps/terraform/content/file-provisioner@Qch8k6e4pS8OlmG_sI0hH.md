# file provisioner

The Terraform file provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine running Terraform to a newly created resource. It's useful for tasks like uploading configuration files, scripts, or other necessary data to remote systems. The file provisioner can copy a single file or recursively copy directories. It supports both source and content arguments, allowing for either file-based or inline content transfers. This provisioner is often used in conjunction with remote-exec provisioners to execute uploaded scripts. While convenient for simple file transfers, it's important to consider security implications, especially when dealing with sensitive data. For more complex or large-scale file management tasks, dedicated configuration management tools are often preferred. The file provisioner is best used for small, straightforward file transfers needed to bootstrap or configure newly created resources.
