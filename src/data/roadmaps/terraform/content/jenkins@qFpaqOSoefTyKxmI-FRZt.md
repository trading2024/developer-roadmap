# Jenkins

Using Terraform with Jenkins enables automated infrastructure management within a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline. This integration allows for consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments alongside application builds. In a typical setup, Jenkins jobs or pipelines are configured to execute Terraform commands, such as `init`, `plan`, and `apply`. Jenkins can manage different environments by using parameters or separate jobs for each environment. Proper credential management is crucial for securely handling cloud provider access keys. Jenkins' rich plugin ecosystem can enhance Terraform workflows with additional features like visualization and notification capabilities.
