# Authentication

HCP (HashiCorp Cloud Platform) authentication provides secure access management for its services, including Terraform Cloud. It utilizes a comprehensive identity and access management system that supports multiple authentication methods. These include username/password combinations, single sign-on (SSO) integration with popular identity providers, and API tokens for programmatic access. HCP supports SAML 2.0 for enterprise-grade SSO, allowing seamless integration with existing identity management systems. For machine-to-machine communication, HCP offers service principal authentication, enabling secure, automated interactions with HCP services. The platform also provides fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC), allowing administrators to define and manage user permissions across different resources and operations.
