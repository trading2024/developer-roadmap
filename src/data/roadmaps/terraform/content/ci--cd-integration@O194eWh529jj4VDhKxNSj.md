# CI / CD Integration

CI/CD integration with Terraform involves incorporating infrastructure-as-code practices into continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines. This integration automates the process of planning, validating, and applying Terraform configurations as part of software delivery workflows.

In a typical setup, CI/CD pipelines run Terraform commands to check syntax, generate plans, and apply changes to infrastructure. This approach ensures that infrastructure changes are versioned, tested, and deployed consistently alongside application code. Key aspects include automated testing of Terraform configurations, secure handling of sensitive data like access keys, and implementing approval processes for infrastructure changes.
