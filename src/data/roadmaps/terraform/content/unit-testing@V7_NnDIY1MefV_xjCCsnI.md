# Unit Testing

Terraform unit testing focuses on verifying the behavior of individual modules or components in isolation. It typically involves creating small, focused test cases that validate the expected outputs and resource configurations of a module given specific inputs. Tools like Terratest, a Go library, are commonly used for writing and running these tests. Unit tests for Terraform might check if resources are correctly defined, if count and for_each meta-arguments work as expected, or if output values are calculated correctly. These tests often use mock data or minimal real infrastructure to simulate various scenarios. While they don't guarantee the actual creation of resources, unit tests are valuable for quickly catching logic errors, ensuring module interfaces work as intended, and maintaining code quality as modules evolve.
