# Modules

Terraform modules are reusable components that encapsulate a set of resources, their configurations, and their interconnections. They allow for organizing Terraform code into logical, self-contained units that can be shared and reused across different projects or within the same project. Modules promote code reusability, maintainability, and consistency in infrastructure deployments. They can accept input variables, produce output values, and be nested within other modules. By using modules, teams can create standardized infrastructure components, enforce best practices, and simplify complex configurations. Modules can be sourced from local directories, version control systems, or public registries like the Terraform Registry. Effective use of modules can significantly reduce code duplication, improve infrastructure management, and enable the creation of scalable, maintainable Terraform configurations.
