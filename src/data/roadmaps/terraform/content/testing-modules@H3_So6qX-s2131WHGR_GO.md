# Testing Modules

Testing Terraform modules involves validating their functionality, reusability, and correctness in isolation and as part of larger systems. This process typically includes unit testing to verify individual module behavior, integration testing to ensure proper interaction with other components, and sometimes end-to-end testing for complex modules. Tests often use tools like Terratest or custom scripts to automate the creation of resources, verification of outputs, and cleanup. Key aspects include testing various input combinations, verifying resource attributes and outputs, and ensuring idempotency. Module testing also involves checking for proper handling of edge cases and error conditions. While it requires initial setup effort, thorough module testing enhances reliability, facilitates refactoring, and improves overall infrastructure code quality.
