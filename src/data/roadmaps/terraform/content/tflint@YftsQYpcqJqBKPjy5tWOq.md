# TFLint

TFLint is a third-party, extensible linter for Terraform code. It performs static analysis of Terraform configurations to detect potential errors, enforce best practices, and maintain code consistency. Key features include: Checking for potential errors that terraform validate might miss, enforcing naming conventions and code style rules, identifying deprecated syntax or resource types and, providing cloud provider-specific checks

TFLint is configurable via .tflint.hcl files and supports custom rules. It can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated code quality checks. While not an official Terraform tool, TFLint is widely used in the Terraform community to complement built-in validation tools and improve overall code quality and reliability in infrastructure-as-code projects.
