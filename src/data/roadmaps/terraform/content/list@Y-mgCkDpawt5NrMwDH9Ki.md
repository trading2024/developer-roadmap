# list

The terraform list command is used to display a list of resources within the Terraform state. It provides a quick overview of all the resources currently being managed by Terraform in your configuration. This command is particularly useful when working with large or complex infrastructures, allowing developers to quickly see what resources are under Terraform's control. The output includes the resource type and name for each managed resource, making it easy to identify specific elements of your infrastructure. It's often used in conjunction with other state manipulation commands to verify the contents of the state or to identify resources for further inspection or modification.
