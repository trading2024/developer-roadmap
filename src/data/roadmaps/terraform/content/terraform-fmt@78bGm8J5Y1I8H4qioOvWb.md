# terraform fmt

terraform fmt is a command in Terraform that automatically formats configuration files to a consistent style. It adjusts indentation, aligns arguments, and sorts blocks and arguments alphabetically. The command rewrites Terraform configuration files (.tf and .tfvars) in the current directory and its subdirectories. It's used to maintain a consistent coding style across projects and teams, improving readability and reducing merge conflicts. The command can be run with options like -recursive to format files in subdirectories, -diff to show the differences, or -check to validate formatting without making changes. Regularly using terraform fmt is considered a best practice in Terraform development workflows.
