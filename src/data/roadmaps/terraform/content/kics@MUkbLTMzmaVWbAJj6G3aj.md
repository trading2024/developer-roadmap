# KICS

KICS (Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure) is an open-source static analysis tool designed to scan Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files, including Terraform configurations, for security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations. It supports multiple IaC technologies and cloud providers, offering a comprehensive approach to securing cloud-native environments. KICS uses a robust set of predefined rules to detect potential security risks, ranging from insecure defaults to violations of industry standards and best practices. The tool allows for custom query development, enabling organizations to tailor scans to their specific security and compliance needs. KICS can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines, providing early detection of issues in the development lifecycle. Its ability to generate detailed reports and support various output formats facilitates easy interpretation of results and integration with other security and DevOps tools, making it a valuable asset in maintaining secure and compliant infrastructure deployments managed through Terraform.
