# Trivy

Trivy is a comprehensive, open-source security scanner primarily known for container image scanning, but it also supports Infrastructure as Code (IaC) analysis, including Terraform configurations. It can detect vulnerabilities in dependencies, misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure setups, and potential security risks in Terraform code. Trivy's IaC scanning capabilities cover various cloud providers and can identify issues related to compliance, security best practices, and common misconfigurations. The tool is designed for easy integration into CI/CD pipelines, offering fast scanning times and multiple output formats for better reporting and integration with other DevOps tools. Trivy's strength lies in its ability to provide a unified scanning solution across different aspects of the software development lifecycle, from container images to IaC, making it a versatile tool for maintaining security throughout the development and deployment process.
