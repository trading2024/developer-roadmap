# Deployment Workflow

A Terraform deployment workflow for scaling typically involves several key stages optimized for managing large infrastructures. It starts with code development in feature branches, followed by automated testing including syntax checks, linting, and unit tests. Pull requests trigger plan generations for review. After approval, changes merge to a main branch, initiating a CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline runs more comprehensive tests, including integration and possibly end-to-end tests. For large infrastructures, the workflow often includes staged deployments, starting with lower environments and progressively moving to production. It may involve partial applies or use of workspaces to manage different environments. The process incorporates manual approval gates for critical changes. State management becomes crucial, often utilizing remote backends with locking. Monitoring and logging are integrated to track deployment progress and catch issues early.
