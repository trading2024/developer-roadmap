# Concurrency

Concurrency in Python allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously using different approaches. GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits thread execution, making multithreading less efficient for computational tasks, but suitable for I/O. Multiprocessing, using the multiprocessing module, allows multiple cores to be utilized, providing true parallelism. Asynchrony via asyncio is optimal for I/O operations, allowing thousands of connections to be processed simultaneously without blocking. The choice of approach depends on the nature of the task.
