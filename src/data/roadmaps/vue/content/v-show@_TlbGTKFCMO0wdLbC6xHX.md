# v-show

`v-show` is similar to `v-if` in that it allows you to conditionally render components. However, it does not remove the component from the DOM and merely toggles its `display` CSS property to be `hidden`. It also does not work with `v-else-if` oe `v-else`.

Prefer `v-show` over `v-if` if the component's visibility needs to change often, and `v-if` if not.
