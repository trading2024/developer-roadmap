# Nano: A File Editing Tool 

Nano is a popular, user-friendly text editor used for creating and editing files directly within the Linux command line interface (CLI). It is an alternative to editors like `Vi` and `Emacs` and is considered more straightforward for beginners due to its simple and intuitive interface.

Nano comes pre-installed with many Linux distributions but if it's not installed, here's how to do it for popular Linux distributions.

```bash
# Ubuntu based distributions
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nano

```
```bash
# Arch Linux 
sudo pacman -S nano
```
To use Nano to edit or create files in Linux, the following command can be used:

```bash
nano filename
```
