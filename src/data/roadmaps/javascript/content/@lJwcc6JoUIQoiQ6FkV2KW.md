# Strict Equality Operator (===)
In JavaScript, the strict equality operator `===` compares both the value and the type of two operands. This means that it will only return true if both the value and the type are identical.
```sh
"5" === "5"   // true
```
In this case, both the value and the type are the same, so the result is true.
```sh
"5" === 5   // false
```
Here, although the values might appear similar, the types are different (string and number), so the result is false. The strict equality operator does not perform type coercion; both the value and the type must be identical.
