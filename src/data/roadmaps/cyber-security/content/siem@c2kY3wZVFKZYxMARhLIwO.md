# SIEM

SIEM, short for Security Information and Event Manager, is a term used to describe tools that greatly increases visibility into a network or system. 
It does this by monitoring, filtering, collecting, normalizing, and correlating vast amounts of data such as logs, and neatly presents it via an interface/dashboard. 

Organizations leverage SIEMs to monitor and thus identify, protect, and respond to potential threats in their environment. 

For hands-on experience, you should consider setting up a SIEM in your own environment. A common stack widely used for various purposes across the industry is the ELK-stack.
