## True Negative / True Positive

A true positive is an instance when security tools correctly detect and identify a threat, such as a malware or intrusion attempt. A high number of true positives indicates that a security tool is working effectively and catching potential threats as required.

A true negative occurs when the security tool correctly identifies that there is no threat or attack in a given situation. In other words, the system does not raise an alarm when there is no attack happening. A high number of true negatives show that the security tool is not overly sensitive, generating unnecessary alerts.
