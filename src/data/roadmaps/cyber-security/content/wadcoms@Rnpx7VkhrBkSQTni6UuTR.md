WADcoms (Web Application Dangerous Commands) is a comprehensive database of dangerous web application commands and patterns that can be exploited to compromise web security. It offers a catalog of potentially harmful commands and their contexts, helping security professionals identify and mitigate risks associated with web applications by understanding how these commands can be misused for attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution (RCE).
