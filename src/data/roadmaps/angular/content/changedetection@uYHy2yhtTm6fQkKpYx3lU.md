# changeDetection

The change-detection strategy to use for this component.

When a component is instantiated, Angular creates a change detector, which is responsible for propagating the
component's bindings. The strategy is one of:

- `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` sets the strategy to CheckOnce (on demand).
- `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` sets the strategy to CheckAlways.
