# Route Guards

Use route guards to prevent users from navigating to parts of an application without authorization.

Angular route guards are interfaces provided by Angular that, when implemented, allow us 
to control the accessibility of a route based on conditions provided in function implementation of that interface.

Some types of angular guards are `CanActivate`, `CanActivateChild`, `CanDeactivate`, `CanMatch` and `Resolve`.
