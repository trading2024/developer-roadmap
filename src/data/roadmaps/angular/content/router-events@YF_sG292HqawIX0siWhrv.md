# Router Events

The Angular Router raises events when it navigates from one route to another route. It raises several events such as `NavigationStart`, `NavigationEnd`, `NavigationCancel`, `NavigationError`, `ResolveStart`, etc. You can listen to these events and find out when the state of the route changes. Some of the useful events are route change start (NavigationStart) and route change end (NavigationEnd).
