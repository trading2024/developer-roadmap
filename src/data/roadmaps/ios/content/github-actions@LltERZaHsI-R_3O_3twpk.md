# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool integrated directly into GitHub, allowing developers to automate workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying code directly from their repositories. It uses YAML files to define workflows, which can be triggered by various events like pushes, pull requests, or on a schedule. GitHub Actions supports a wide range of actions and integrations, making it highly customizable for different project needs. It provides a marketplace with reusable workflows and actions contributed by the community. With its seamless integration with GitHub, developers can take advantage of features like matrix builds, secrets management, and environment-specific configurations to streamline and enhance their development and deployment processes.
