# Async / Await

Async/await in Swift is a modern approach to handling asynchronous operations, introduced to simplify complex asynchronous code and mitigate the challenges of callback-based programming. This feature allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, improving readability and maintainability. The 'async' keyword marks functions that can be suspended and resumed, while 'await' is used to call these functions and wait for their completion without blocking the entire thread. This pattern integrates seamlessly with Swift's error handling mechanism, allowing for more natural try-catch blocks in asynchronous contexts. Async/await works with Swift's structured concurrency system, including tasks and actors, to manage complex asynchronous operations more easily.
