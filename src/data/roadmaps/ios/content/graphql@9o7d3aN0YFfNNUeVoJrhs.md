# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs, offering an alternative to traditional REST APIs in iOS development. It allows clients to request specific data structures, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data common in REST. In iOS apps, GraphQL enables more efficient network usage by allowing precise data requests tailored to UI needs. Developers typically use libraries like Apollo iOS to integrate GraphQL, which handles query execution, caching, and data normalization. GraphQL's strong typing system aligns well with Swift, facilitating type-safe API interactions. It supports real-time data with subscriptions, useful for live updates in iOS apps. While GraphQL offers flexibility and performance benefits, it requires a mindset shift from REST, including different approaches to error handling and caching. Implementing GraphQL in iOS involves crafting queries, managing the schema, and often requires coordination with backend teams to design effective GraphQL APIs that cater to mobile app needs.
