# Data binding

SwiftUI data binding is a mechanism that creates a two-way connection between a piece of data and a UI element. It uses the `@Binding` property wrapper to allow child views to share and modify data owned by parent views. Bindings ensure that changes in data are immediately reflected in the UI and vice versa. They are typically created using the `$` prefix on a `@State` property. This approach facilitates the flow of data through an app's view hierarchy, enabling reactive UI updates and maintaining a single source of truth.
