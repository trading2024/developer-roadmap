# Operation Queues

Operation Queues in iOS provide a high-level, object-oriented approach to managing concurrent tasks. Built on top of Grand Central Dispatch, they offer more flexibility and control over task execution compared to raw GCD. Operation Queues work with Operation objects, which encapsulate work to be performed and can include dependencies, cancellation, and prioritization. These queues allow for easy management of task dependencies, ensuring that operations are executed in the correct order. They support both synchronous and asynchronous operations, making them suitable for a wide range of concurrency scenarios. Operation Queues provide built-in support for maximum concurrent operation limits, helping to prevent system overload. Developers can subclass NSOperation to create custom, complex operations with intricate logic and state management. This abstraction layer simplifies the implementation of advanced concurrency patterns, making Operation Queues particularly useful for managing complex, interdependent background tasks in iOS applications.
