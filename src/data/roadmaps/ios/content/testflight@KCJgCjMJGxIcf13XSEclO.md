# TestFlight

TestFlight is Apple's beta testing service for iOS applications, allowing developers to distribute their apps to internal and external testers before the official release on the App Store. Through TestFlight, developers can invite users via email or a public link to test the app and provide feedback. Testers can then download the app directly to their devices using the TestFlight app. Developers can distribute up to 100 internal testers (using iTunes Connect user roles) and up to 10,000 external testers per app. TestFlight provides valuable insights by collecting feedback and crash reports, helping identify issues and improve app quality. It supports testing of multiple builds simultaneously and manages app versioning and expiration, streamlining the beta testing process significantly.
