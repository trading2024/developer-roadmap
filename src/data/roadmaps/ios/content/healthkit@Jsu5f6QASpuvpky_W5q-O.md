# HealthKit

HealthKit is a powerful framework that allows developers to create health and fitness applications that can interact seamlessly with the iOS `Health app`.

HealthKit provides a central repository for health and fitness data on iPhone and Apple Watch. With the userâ€™s permission, apps communicate with the HealthKit store to access and share this data.
