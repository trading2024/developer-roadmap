# Operators

RxSwift operators are functions that process, transform, or combine observable sequences. They allow developers to manipulate data streams in powerful ways. Common operators include map (transform elements), filter (select elements based on criteria), flatMap (transform elements into new observables), merge (combine multiple observables), and debounce (limit emission rate). Operators can be chained to create complex data processing pipelines. They handle tasks like error management, retrying failed operations, and combining asynchronous operations.
