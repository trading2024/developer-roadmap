# Networking

Networking in iOS development involves the exchange of data between an app and remote servers or services over the internet. At the core of iOS networking is URLSession, a powerful class within the Foundation framework that handles HTTP/HTTPS communications. URLSession supports a wide range of operations, from simple data fetching to complex, concurrent downloads and uploads. Developers use it to create data tasks for basic requests, download tasks for file transfers, and upload tasks for sending data to servers. URLSession manages connections, authentication, and caching automatically. iOS networking often revolves around interacting with RESTful APIs, typically using JSON for data interchange. Robust networking code requires careful error handling, efficient response parsing, and effective management of network reachability. Modern Swift features like the Combine framework and async/await syntax complement URLSession by providing more elegant ways to handle asynchronous network operations, enhancing code readability and maintainability in complex scenarios.
