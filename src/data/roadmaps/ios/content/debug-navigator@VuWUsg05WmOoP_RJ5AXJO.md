# Debug Navigator

The Xcode Debug Navigator is a powerful tool in the Navigator pane that provides detailed information about the running application during debugging sessions. Key features include:

1. Process hierarchy: Displays all running processes and threads.
2. CPU and memory usage: Shows real-time performance metrics.
3. Disk activity: Monitors file system operations.
4. Network activity: Tracks network requests and responses.
5. Energy impact: Measures the app's energy consumption.
6. GPU usage: Monitors graphics processing utilization.
7. iCloud activity: Tracks iCloud-related operations.
8. Thread states: Visualizes the state of each thread (running, blocked, etc.).
9. Stacktrace view: Allows navigation through the call stack of selected threads.

The Debug Navigator helps developers identify performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and other runtime issues. It's particularly useful for optimizing app performance and troubleshooting complex multi-threaded scenarios.
