# Breakpoints

Xcode debugger breakpoints are powerful tools for pausing program execution at specific points, allowing developers to inspect the application state and diagnose issues. Key features include:

1. Line breakpoints: Set on specific code lines to pause execution.
2. Symbolic breakpoints: Trigger on function or method names.
3. Exception breakpoints: Pause when exceptions occur.
4. Conditional breakpoints: Only activate when certain conditions are met.
5. Action breakpoints: Perform custom actions when hit, like logging or running scripts.
6. Breakpoint navigator: Centralized management of all breakpoints.
7. Enable/disable options: Easily toggle breakpoints without removing them.
8. Breakpoint groups: Organize and manage sets of related breakpoints.

Breakpoints can be set by clicking in the gutter of the source editor or through the Breakpoint Navigator.
