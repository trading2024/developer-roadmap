# Tailor

Tailor is a cross-platform static analysis and lint tool specifically designed for Swift code. It aims to enforce Swift style and conventions, helping developers maintain consistent and clean codebases. Tailor analyzes Swift source files and reports on various style, performance, and maintainability issues. It can detect problems like unused variables, overly complex functions, and violations of naming conventions. The tool is highly configurable, allowing teams to customize rules to match their specific coding standards. Tailor can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines, providing automated code quality checks with each commit. While less popular than some other linting tools like SwiftLint, Tailor offers a straightforward, cross-platform solution for Swift code analysis. Its use can help teams catch potential issues early in the development process, promote best practices, and maintain a more uniform code style across projects.
