# Components

Components are built by composing primitive views like Text, Image, and Button, along with container views such as VStack and HStack. They can accept parameters for customization and use `@State` and `@Binding` for internal state management and data flow. SwiftUI's modifiers allow for styling and behavior adjustments. Components can be extracted into separate files for reusability across the app. This approach encourages a modular design, improving code organization and maintainability.
