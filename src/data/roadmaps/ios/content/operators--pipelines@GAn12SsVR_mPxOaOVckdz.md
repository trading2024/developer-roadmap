# Operators & Pipelines

The Combine framework uses operators and pipelines to process and transform data streams. Operators are methods that perform operations on publishers, such as filtering, mapping, or combining data. Pipelines are chains of these operators that process data from its source to its final destination. Common operators include `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `merge`. Pipelines allow developers to declaratively describe complex asynchronous operations, handling tasks like data transformation, error management, and combining multiple data sources. This approach simplifies handling of asynchronous events and state changes, enabling more robust and maintainable code in iOS applications.
