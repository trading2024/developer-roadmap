# View Transitions

SwiftUI view transitions provide a fluid and intuitive way to animate changes in the user interface, enhancing the overall user experience. These transitions can be applied to individual views or entire view hierarchies, allowing developers to create smooth animations for appearance, disappearance, and modification of UI elements. SwiftUI offers a range of built-in transition effects, such as fade, move, and scale, which can be easily customized and combined to create more complex animations. By leveraging the `.transition()` modifier, developers can specify how views enter and exit the screen, while the `animation()` modifier controls the timing and style of these transitions.
