# Basics / Creating Animations

Creating animations with Core Animation involves manipulating `CALayer` properties over time. Developers can use `CABasicAnimation` for simple property changes, or `CAKeyframeAnimation` for more complex, multi-step animations. Animations are added to layers using the `addAnimation(_:forKey:)` method. Common properties animated include position, bounds, transform, and opacity. Core Animation provides timing functions to control the pace of animations, and allows for grouping multiple animations using `CAAnimationGroup`. For view-level animations, UIView's animate methods serve as a convenient wrapper around Core Animation.
