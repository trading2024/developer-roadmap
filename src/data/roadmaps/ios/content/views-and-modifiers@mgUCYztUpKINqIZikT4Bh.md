# Views and Modifiers

SwiftUI views and modifiers form the core of UI development in the framework. Views are structs conforming to the View protocol, representing visual elements of the interface. They are lightweight, value types that describe the content and layout. Modifiers are methods called on views to adjust their appearance or behavior, such as changing colors, adding padding, or attaching gestures. These modifiers return new view instances, allowing for a chain of modifications. SwiftUI uses a declarative approach where views and modifiers are composed to create complex UI elements. The system efficiently manages view updates and redraws based on state changes. Custom views can be easily created by combining existing views and modifiers, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
