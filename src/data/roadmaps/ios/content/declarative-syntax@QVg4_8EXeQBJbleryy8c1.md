# Declarative Syntax

SwiftUI's declarative syntax allows developers to describe the desired UI state rather than the step-by-step process to achieve it. This approach uses Swift code to define what views should appear and how they should behave, with SwiftUI handling the underlying implementation details. Developers create views by combining and modifying smaller view components, using modifiers to adjust appearance and behavior. State management is integrated into this syntax, with UI automatically updating when state changes.
