# Editors

Xcode editors are the central workspace for code creation and modification. The main types include:

1. Source Editor: For writing and editing code, featuring syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation.
2. Interface Builder: A visual editor for designing user interfaces, supporting both Storyboards and XIB files.
3. Assistant Editor: Allows viewing related files side-by-side, useful for simultaneously editing header and implementation files.
4. Version Editor: For comparing and merging different versions of a file.
5. Property List Editor: A specialized editor for working with .plist files.
6. Core Data Model Editor: For designing and managing Core Data models.

The Editor area supports multiple tabs and split views, enabling developers to work on multiple files simultaneously.
