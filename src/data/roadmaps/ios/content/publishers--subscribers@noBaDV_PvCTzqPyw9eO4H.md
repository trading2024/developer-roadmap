# Publishers / Subscribers

The Combine framework in iOS uses Publishers and Subscribers as core components for reactive programming. Publishers are types that can emit a sequence of values over time, representing sources of asynchronous events or data. Subscribers receive and process these values, defining how to handle the published data. Publishers can emit multiple values, complete successfully, or terminate with an error. Subscribers can receive and react to these events, often updating UI or triggering further operations.
