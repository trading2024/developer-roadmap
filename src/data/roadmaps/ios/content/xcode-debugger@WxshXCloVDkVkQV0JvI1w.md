# Xcode Debugger

The Xcode Debugger is an essential tool for iOS developers, providing capabilities to diagnose and resolve issues within the code. It allows setting breakpoints to pause the execution at specific lines, enabling the inspection of variable states and program flow. Developers can step over, into, or out of functions to closely examine the logic. The LLDB (Low-Level Debugger) console supports powerful commands for deeper inspection and manipulation of the appâ€™s state. The debugger also includes features like view debugging to analyze the UI hierarchy and memory graph debugging to detect memory leaks and retain cycles, making it a comprehensive tool for troubleshooting and optimizing iOS applications.
