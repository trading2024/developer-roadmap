# XCTest

XCTest is Apple's framework for writing and running unit tests, performance tests, and UI tests in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. It allows developers to create test cases and test methods to verify the correctness of their code, ensuring that individual components function as expected. XCTest supports assertions to check for expected outcomes, and it can run tests in parallel to speed up the testing process. For UI testing, XCTest provides capabilities to record user interactions and generate corresponding test scripts, which can be replayed to simulate user behavior. Additionally, XCTest integrates seamlessly with Xcode's testing infrastructure, providing detailed reports and continuous integration support to maintain code quality and performance throughout the development lifecycle.
