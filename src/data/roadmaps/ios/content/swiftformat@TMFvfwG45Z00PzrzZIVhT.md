# SwiftFormat

SwiftFormat is a powerful command-line tool and Xcode extension designed to automatically format Swift code according to a set of predefined or custom rules. It helps maintain consistent code style across projects and teams by automatically adjusting whitespace, braces, and other formatting details. SwiftFormat can be easily integrated into development workflows, either as a pre-commit hook, as part of a continuous integration process, or directly within Xcode. It supports a wide range of formatting rules, from basic indentation and line wrapping to more complex transformations like organizing import statements and standardizing access control modifiers. The tool is highly configurable, allowing developers to create custom rule sets that align with their team's coding standards. By automating the formatting process, SwiftFormat saves time, reduces code review discussions about style, and helps maintain a clean, readable codebase. Its ability to format entire projects quickly makes it particularly valuable for large-scale Swift applications and teams focused on code quality and consistency.
