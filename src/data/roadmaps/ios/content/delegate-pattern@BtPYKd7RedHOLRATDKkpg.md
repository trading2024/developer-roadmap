# Delegate Pattern

The delegate pattern is a widely used design pattern in iOS development that facilitates communication between objects in a flexible and decoupled manner. It allows one object to delegate certain responsibilities or decisions to another object, typically through a protocol. This pattern is particularly useful for handling events or customizing behavior without creating tight dependencies between classes. In implementation, a delegate protocol defines methods that the delegating object can call, while the delegate object conforms to this protocol and provides specific implementations. This approach promotes loose coupling, enhances reusability, and allows for easy customization of component behavior. The delegate pattern is extensively used in UIKit for handling user interactions, data source management, and event callbacks, making it a fundamental concept in iOS app architecture and design.
