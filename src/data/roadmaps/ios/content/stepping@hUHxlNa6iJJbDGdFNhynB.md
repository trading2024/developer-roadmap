# Stepping

Xcode debugger stepping allows developers to execute code line by line, providing detailed control over program flow during debugging. Key stepping commands include:

1. Step Over: Executes the current line and moves to the next, without entering functions.
2. Step Into: Enters into the function call on the current line.
3. Step Out: Completes the current function and returns to the calling line.
4. Continue: Resumes normal execution until the next breakpoint.
5. Step Into Instruction: Moves to the next machine instruction (for low-level debugging).
6. Step Over Instruction: Executes the current machine instruction without entering calls.

These controls are accessible via the debug toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, or the Debug menu.
