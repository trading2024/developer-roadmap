# Static Library

Static libraries in iOS development are collections of compiled code that are linked directly into an app's executable at build time. They contain object code that becomes part of the final application binary, increasing its size but potentially improving load time performance. Static libraries are typically distributed as .a files, often accompanied by header files that define their public interfaces. When using static libraries, the entire library code is included in the app, even if only a portion is used, which can lead to larger app sizes. However, this approach ensures that all necessary code is available within the app, eliminating runtime dependencies. Static libraries are particularly useful for distributing closed-source code or when aiming to minimize runtime overhead. They offer simplicity in distribution and version management but may require recompilation of the entire app when the library is updated. In iOS development, static libraries are gradually being replaced by more flexible options like dynamic frameworks and XCFrameworks, especially for larger or frequently updated libraries.
