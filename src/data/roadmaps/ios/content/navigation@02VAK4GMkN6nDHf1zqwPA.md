# Navigation

SwiftUI navigation offers a declarative approach to managing app structure and flow, primarily utilizing NavigationView for creating hierarchies and NavigationLink for inter-view navigation. The framework supports both push-based navigation for hierarchical content and modal presentations for overlays, with programmatic navigation achieved through state management for dynamic, logic-driven navigation. SwiftUI automatically handles navigation bars, back buttons, and view transitions, while supporting customization of navigation bar appearances and titles. For tab-based interfaces, TabView facilitates the creation of multi-tab applications. This navigation system integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI's state management, ensuring consistent UI updates as navigation states change, thereby simplifying the implementation of complex navigation patterns while maintaining an intuitive user experience across Apple platforms.
