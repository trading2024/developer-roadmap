# Navigation Stacks

UIKit Navigation Stacks, managed by UINavigationController, provide a hierarchical way to organize content in iOS apps. The stack operates on a last-in-first-out basis, where view controllers are pushed onto or popped from the top. The root view controller remains at the bottom, while subsequent screens are added above it. This structure allows for intuitive drill-down interfaces and easy back-navigation. Navigation stacks automatically handle transitions between view controllers, maintain a navigation bar with titles and back buttons, and can be customized for specific navigation patterns. They are fundamental to creating depth in app navigation, enabling users to traverse complex information hierarchies efficiently.
