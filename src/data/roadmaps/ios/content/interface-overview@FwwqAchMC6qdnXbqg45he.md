# Interface overview

Xcode's interface is designed for efficient iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development. The main window is divided into several key areas:

1. Toolbar: Contains run buttons, scheme selector, and status display.
2. Navigator Area (left): Includes file navigator, search, issue navigator, and test navigator.
3. Editor Area (center): The main coding space, supporting multiple editors and Interface Builder.
4. Utility Area (right): Shows file inspectors, Quick Help, and Interface Builder libraries.
5. Debug Area (bottom): Displays console output and variables during debugging.
6. Assistant Editor: Allows viewing related files side-by-side.
7. Version Editor: For managing and comparing different versions of code.

The interface is highly customizable, allowing developers to adjust layouts and show/hide areas as needed for their workflow. This integrated environment provides tools for coding, UI design, testing, and debugging all in one application.
