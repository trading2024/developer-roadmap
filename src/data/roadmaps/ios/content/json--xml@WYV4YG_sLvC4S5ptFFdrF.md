# JSON / XML

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are widely used data interchange formats in iOS development, each with its own strengths and use cases. JSON has become increasingly popular due to its lightweight nature and ease of use, particularly in web services and APIs. Swift provides built-in support for JSON encoding and decoding through the Codable protocol, simplifying the process of converting between JSON data and Swift objects. XML, while less common in modern APIs, is still used in certain scenarios, especially for complex, hierarchical data structures. iOS provides the XMLParser class for parsing XML data, though it requires more manual handling compared to JSON. Both formats support data serialization and deserialization, allowing for easy storage and transmission of structured data. When working with external APIs or services, the choice between JSON and XML is often dictated by the service provider, but for internal data storage or custom APIs, JSON is generally preferred for its simplicity and performance in mobile environments.
