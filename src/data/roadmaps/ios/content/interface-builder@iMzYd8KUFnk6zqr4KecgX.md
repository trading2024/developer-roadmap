# Interface Builder

Xcode Interface Builder is a visual design tool for creating user interfaces in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. Key features include:

1. Drag-and-drop UI design: Easily add and arrange UI elements on the canvas.
2. Storyboards: Create and manage multiple screens and their connections.
3. Auto Layout: Set up adaptive layouts using constraints.
4. Size classes: Design interfaces for different device sizes and orientations.
5. Custom controls: Integrate custom UI components alongside system-provided ones.
6. IBOutlets and IBActions: Connect UI elements to code.
7. Preview: Visualize designs on different devices and orientations.
8. Accessibility inspector: Ensure UI elements are accessible.
9. Localization: Manage multiple language versions of the interface.

Interface Builder integrates seamlessly with Xcode's coding environment, allowing developers to switch between visual design and code implementation. It supports both .xib files for individual view controllers and .storyboard files for more complex, multi-screen interfaces.
