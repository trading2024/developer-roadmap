# RxSwift with MVVM

RxSwift integrates seamlessly with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture in iOS development. In this combination, ViewModels expose Observable properties that Views can bind to, creating a reactive data flow. Models emit data changes through Observables, which ViewModels transform and expose to Views. This setup allows for clean, declarative bindings between Views and ViewModels, reducing boilerplate code and improving testability. RxSwift's operators facilitate complex data transformations within ViewModels, while its Subjects can handle user inputs.
