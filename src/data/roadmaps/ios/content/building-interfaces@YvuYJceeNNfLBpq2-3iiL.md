# Building Interfaces

SwiftUI is Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms using Swift. It employs a declarative syntax where UI is described using Swift code, defining what should appear rather than how to create it. Xcode provides real-time previews of the UI as you code, enhancing the development experience. SwiftUI uses property wrappers like `@State` for managing UI state, and offers a flexible layout system with VStack, HStack, and ZStack. Complex UIs are built by composing smaller, reusable views, and data flow between views is managed using `@Binding` and `@ObservedObject`. The framework provides chainable modifiers for customizing view appearance and behavior, easy-to-implement declarative animations, and built-in support for common gestures. SwiftUI simplifies UI development by reducing boilerplate code and offering a more intuitive way to create responsive, adaptive interfaces that can target iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS from a single codebase.
