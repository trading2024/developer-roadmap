# Callbacks

Callbacks in Swift provide a mechanism for asynchronous communication between different parts of an application. They allow a function to pass control back to the caller once a task is completed, making them particularly useful for handling time-consuming operations or events that occur at unpredictable times. In Swift, callbacks are often implemented using closures, which are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and executed later. This approach is commonly used in network operations, user interface events, and any scenario where the result of an operation isn't immediately available.

While simple to implement for basic use cases, callbacks can lead to complex nested structures (often referred to as "callback hell") in more intricate scenarios. To mitigate this, Swift offers more advanced patterns like completion handlers, promises, and async/await syntax, which provide cleaner ways to handle asynchronous operations while maintaining the core concept of passing control back to the caller upon completion.
