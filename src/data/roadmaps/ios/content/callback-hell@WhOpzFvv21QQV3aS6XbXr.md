# Callback Hell

Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, is a common issue in asynchronous programming where multiple nested callbacks create code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain. This problem typically arises when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that depend on each other's results. As callbacks are nested within callbacks, the code structure becomes deeply indented, resembling a pyramid shape. This nesting not only hampers code readability but also makes error handling and flow control more complex. To mitigate callback hell, developers often employ techniques such as modularizing code, using named functions instead of anonymous closures, or adopting more advanced asynchronous patterns. Modern Swift development addresses this issue through the use of promises, futures, completion handlers, and most recently, the async/await pattern, which provides a more linear and readable approach to handling asynchronous operations.
