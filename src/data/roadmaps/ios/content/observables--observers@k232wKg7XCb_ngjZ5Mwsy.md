# Observables & observers

RxSwift Observables and Observers form the core of its reactive paradigm. Observables represent sequences of data or events over time, emitting items to subscribed Observers. Observers react to these emissions, handling new values, errors, or completion signals. This pattern allows for decoupling of data production from consumption, facilitating asynchronous programming. Observables can represent various data sources like UI events, network responses, or timer ticks. Observers can be chained with operators to transform or filter data streams. This approach simplifies complex asynchronous operations, making code more readable and maintainable.
