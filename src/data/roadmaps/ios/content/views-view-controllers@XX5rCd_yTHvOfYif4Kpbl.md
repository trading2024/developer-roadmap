# Views, View Controllers

UIKit Views and View Controllers are fundamental components in iOS app development.

Views (UIView) are the basic building blocks of user interfaces, representing rectangular areas that can display content and respond to user interactions. They can be customized, combined, and nested to create complex layouts. Common subclasses include UILabel, UIButton, and UIImageView.

View Controllers (UIViewController) manage a set of views and coordinate the flow of data between the app's data model and the views. They handle view lifecycle, respond to user actions, and manage transitions between different parts of the user interface. View controllers are crucial for organizing app structure and maintaining separation of concerns in UIKit-based applications.
