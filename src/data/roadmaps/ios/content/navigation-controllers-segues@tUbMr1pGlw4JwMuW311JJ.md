# Navigation Controllers, Segues

UIKit Navigation Controllers and Segues are key components for managing app navigation:

Navigation Controllers (`UINavigationController`) manage a stack of view controllers, providing a hierarchical interface for navigating content. They handle push and pop transitions between screens, maintain a navigation bar, and support back-navigation functionality.

Segues are visual connections between view controllers in storyboards, defining transitions between scenes. They can be triggered programmatically or through user interactions. Types include push, modal, and custom segues. Segues simplify the process of passing data between view controllers during transitions.
