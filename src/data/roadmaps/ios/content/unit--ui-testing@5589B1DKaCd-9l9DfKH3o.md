# Unit & UI Testing

Unit and UI testing are critical components of ensuring the reliability and quality of iOS applications. Unit testing involves writing tests for individual components or functions to verify that they produce the expected results under various conditions, typically using the XCTest framework. These tests are automated, fast, and help catch bugs early in the development cycle. UI testing, on the other hand, involves verifying the app's user interface and user interactions. This can be done using Xcode's UI testing framework, which allows developers to record and write automated tests that simulate user actions like taps, swipes, and text input. Together, unit and UI testing ensure that both the internal logic and the user experience of an app are robust and function correctly as changes are made to the codebase.
