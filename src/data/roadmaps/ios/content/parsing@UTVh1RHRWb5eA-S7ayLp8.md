# Parsing

JSON and XML parsing in iOS involves converting structured data formats into native Swift objects for use within an application. For JSON parsing, Swift's Codable protocol provides a streamlined approach, allowing automatic encoding and decoding of JSON data to and from Swift structs or classes. This system leverages Swift's type inference to create a seamless conversion process, handling most common data structures with minimal code. For more complex JSON structures, custom coding keys and decoding strategies can be implemented. XML parsing, while less common, is typically handled using NSXMLParser or third-party libraries. These parsers often use a delegate-based approach, calling methods as it encounters different elements in the XML structure. Both JSON and XML parsing require careful error handling to manage malformed data or network issues. When dealing with large datasets, considerations for memory management and performance optimization become crucial, often leading to the use of streaming parsers for more efficient processing of extensive data structures.
