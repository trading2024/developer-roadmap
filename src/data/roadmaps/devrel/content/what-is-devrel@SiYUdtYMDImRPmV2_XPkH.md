# What is DevRel?

DevRel, or Developer Relations, is a field that connects a company's technical products or services with the developer community. It encompasses community engagement, technical advocacy, feedback collection, content creation, event participation, and product evangelism.

DevRel professionals build relationships with developers, educate them about company tools and APIs, gather insights for product improvement, produce technical content, represent the company at industry events, and promote technology adoption.

They typically possess both technical expertise and strong communication skills, serving as a vital link between external developers and internal engineering and product teams. DevRel aims to foster a positive ecosystem around a company's technology, driving adoption and user satisfaction.
