# History and Evolution

The first Developer Relations teams came about in the lates 80’s during fierce rivalry between Microsoft and Apple. Apple created a team of “Evangelists” and when Microsoft saw the large impact that this team were having on the sales and adoption of Apple products, they created a their own team of “Technical Evangelists” which later became the Microsoft Developer Relations Group.

DevRel has since evolved into multiple roles within itself, including Developer Marketing, Developer Advocate and Developer Engineer.
