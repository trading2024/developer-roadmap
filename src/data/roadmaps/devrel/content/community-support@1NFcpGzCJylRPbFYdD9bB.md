# Community Support

Community Support in the context of Developer Relations (DevRel) involves actively engaging with and assisting the developer community to foster a collaborative and supportive environment. This includes moderating forums, responding to queries, organizing community events, and facilitating peer-to-peer support. Effective community support ensures that developers feel heard and valued, and have access to timely and accurate assistance, which enhances their overall experience and productivity.
