# Developer Marketing

Developer Marketing focuses on strategies and tactics to engage and attract developers to a product, platform, or service. It involves creating targeted content, such as technical blogs, tutorials, and case studies, that addresses developers' needs and pain points. Effective developer marketing also includes hosting events like hackathons, webinars, and conferences to build community and demonstrate value. By leveraging channels that developers trust, such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, and social media, companies can increase visibility and adoption of their offerings.
