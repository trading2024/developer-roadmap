# Developer Journey

The Developer Journey encompasses the entire process that a developer goes through when interacting with a product or platform, from initial discovery to long-term engagement. This journey includes various stages such as awareness, onboarding, learning, building, deploying, and scaling. Each stage requires thoughtful design and support to ensure a smooth and positive experience. By understanding and optimizing each touchpoint in the Developer Journey, companies can reduce friction, enhance satisfaction, and foster a more loyal and productive developer community.
