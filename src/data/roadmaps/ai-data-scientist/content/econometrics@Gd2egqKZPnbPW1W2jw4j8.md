# Econometrics

Ecenometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data. It is a branch of economics that aims to give empirical content to economic relations. More precisely, it is "the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena based on the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference." Econometrics can be described as something that allows economists "to sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships."
